Movies Documentation
# Overview
This is a movie catalog application built using Spring Boot and React. The app allows users to browse through a collection of movies using a carousel, watch trailers, and write reviews. Future versions of the app will include user authentication (login and register features).

# Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Java-based backend framework for building the REST API.
React: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
HTML and CSS: Used for structuring and styling the user interface.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing movie and user data.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for coding and debugging.

# How to Run
1. Clone the Repository:
bash
[git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/My-Movies-App.git](https://github.com/janina280/Movies)
cd movies

2. Backend (Spring Boot):
Ensure that you have Java and Maven installed.
Configure your MongoDB database connection in application.properties.
Run the Spring Boot application:
bash
mvn spring-boot:run

3. Frontend (React):
Navigate to the frontend folder:
bash
cd frontend

Install dependencies:
bash
npm install

Start the development server:
bash
CopiazÄƒ codul
npm start
4. Open your browser and navigate to:

#Features
Movie Carousel: Users can browse through movies in a carousel format on the homepage.
Watch Trailers: Each movie has a trailer available for viewing.
Write Reviews: Users can write reviews for movies, which are saved in the MongoDB database.
Search Movies: Users can search for specific movies using the search bar.

# Upcoming Features:
User Authentication: Login and registration functionalities to manage personalized user data.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): The primary IDE for developing and debugging the application.

MongoDB: NoSQL database system used to store movies, reviews, and user details.

Backend (Spring Boot):
The backend uses Spring Boot to provide a REST API that the React frontend interacts with.
MongoDB is used to store movie data, user reviews, and other relevant information.
Configuration is stored in the application.properties file. For example:
properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/moviesdb

Frontend (React):
The frontend is built with React and communicates with the backend API to display data dynamically.
CSS is used for styling the application and ensuring a responsive layout.
Notes
Make sure you have Java, Maven, Node.js, npm, and MongoDB installed on your machine before running the application.
Configure the application.properties file with your own MongoDB database credentials.
MongoDB will automatically create the database when the application starts if it does not already exist.
